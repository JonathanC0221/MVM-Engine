# MVM-Engine

A Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MVM) Engine in SystemVerilog, capable of performing multiplication on vectors and matrices of arbitrary sizes. The design features a custom datapath with dot-product units, accumulators, and memory buffers for operand storage, coordinated by control logic to handle any input size. The MVM Engine is pipelined and optimized to meet a minimum timing constraint of 150â€¯MHz.
